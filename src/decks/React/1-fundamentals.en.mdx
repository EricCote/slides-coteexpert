---

## What is React?

- “A JavaScript library for building user interfaces”
- Declarative views are written in JSX (html-like expressions in JS)
- Decompose your app with reusable components
- Allows the creation of SPA (Single Page Apps)
- JSX needs to convert to JavaScript using a compiler tool (Babel, Parcel, SWC...)
- To build a React app, one should use a _toolbox_ (Vite, Astro) or _Framework_ (Next, Gatsby, Remix, TanStack Start
- Or a _MetaFramework_ (Epic Stack, T3, Redwood, Meteor, Ionic, Wasp)

---

## Short history of React

- Created in 2011 by Jordan Walke (Faceboook-Meta)
- 2012: rewrite of Instagram
- 2013: First public release of React Open Source
- 2015: React Native allows Mobile Apps (phone, tablet)
- 2017: React 16 (Fiber rendering)
- 2020: React 17 (Hooks)
- 2022: React 18 (Concurrent rendering)
- 2024: React 19 (Actions, Server Components)

---

## React comes in different flavors

- Lots of rendering engines to choose from
  - React DOM for HTML (most popular)
  - React PDF for PDF documents
  - React Docx for Word documents
  - React Native for phone and tablet apps (Android, iOS, Windows)
  - React TV for TV apps
  - React VR for virtual reality
  - React Remotion for .mp4 videos
  - React Unity for 3D scenes

## React pros

- **Backwards-compatible** new React versions avoid breaking existing apps
- **Popular** Used by a lot of apps, easy to find guidance on the internet
- **Opinion-less** React doesn't care about routing, data-loading, styles, etc.
- **SPA** Compatible with Single Page Application
- **SSR** Compatible with Server-Side Rendering
- **SSG** Compatible with Static Site Generation
- **RSC** Compatible with React Server Components

---

## React Cons

- **Doing bad code is easy** It's easy to end up with spaghetti code with React
- **Some component isn't forward or backward compatible** Components needs to be regularly updated
- **Opinions need to be provided** one must choose a routing library, a data-loading strategy, a caching structure, a styling approach... It's exhausting!
- **No conventions** Each React app has its own way of solving problèmes

---

## React Toolbox

- Lots of tools help us generate a React App
- Back in the day, those tools had to be picked manually:
  - Package Manager (npm, yarn, pnpm)
  - Compiler (Babel, TypeScript, swc)
  - Bundler (WebPack, Parcel, esBuild, swc)
  - Minifier (terser, swc)
  - Web Server (express)
  - Linter (ESLint)
  - Tests (Jest, Cypress)
  - MonoRepo (Nx, Turborepo)

---

## Turnkey Toolbox

- Today, you have a plethora of "ready to use" toolboxes available:
  - Create-React-App (deprecated in 2023)
  - Vite
  - Gatsby
  - Next.js
  - Remix
  - TanStack Start
  - T3
  - Epic Stack

---

## VS Code extensions

- Some useful extensions:

  - **ESLint** (dbaeumer.vscode-eslint): Validates the js code with rules
  - **Prettier** (esbenp.prettier-vscode): Formats web files (css, js, html)

---

## Configure VS Code (1/2)

- Useful Configurations
- Use `cmd-,` (ctrl-comma) to go to 'settings'

  - **Editor:** Default Formatter: Prettier - `esbenp.prettier-vscode`
  - **Editor:** Linked Editing: true (allows renaming of pair of tags)
  - **Editor:** Tab Size: 2 ou 4
  - **Editor:** Format On Save: true
  - **Prettier:** Jsx Single Quote: true
  - **Prettier:** Single Quote: true
  - **Emmet:** Include Language: `"javascript": "javascriptreact"` and `"typescript": "typescriptreact"`

---

## Configure VS Code (2/2)

- **MacOS only:** Add Code to the Terminal "path" command line

  - Need to go to the command palette

```
Shift-Cmd-P  (or F1)
Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH
```

- Quit `code` and close the Terminal
  - Future Terminal windows now have "path" configured.
  - Type `code .` to open the current folder with VS Code.

---

## New Vite Project

To create a new project called _myweb_:

```bash
> npm create vite@latest myweb -- --template react-swc
```

Alternative: Start **vite** in interactive mode. Use arrows and enter to navigate.

```bash
> npm create vite@latest
```

This creates a new folder. Navigate to the new folder.

```bash
> cd myweb
> code .
```

---

## Structure of Vite:

**Files:**

- **index.html** : Empty Html Homepage
- **vite.config.js** : Vite configuration
- **package.json** : npm configuration
- **package-lock.json** : npm versioning file for dependencies and sub-dependencies. **Don't touch.** _npm_ manages this file when you call `npm install` and `npm update`.

**Folders:**

- **node_modules** : contains dependencies and sub-dependencies. **Don't touch.** Use `npm install` or `npm update` to manage.
- **src**: contains .js, .ts, .jsx, .css, and .svg files that are compiled by vite
- **public**: contains files that are served, but not compiled by Vite (png, jpg, pdf, etc)

---

## Start in dev mode

The following commands are launched from the _project root_. (where `package.json` is stored)

You'll need to install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Launch the project in dev mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts a web server in dev mode. Type the letter <kbd>o</kbd> and <kbd>enter</kbd> to open the browser. (Or navigate to: http://localhost:5173 )

---

## Fast Refresh (Hot Module Reload, HMR)

- Modify `src/app.jsx` and save,
  - This will automatically update the browser, no need to _refresh_
- This feature is called _React Fast Refresh_ (also _Hot Reload_)
- _Fast Refresh_ will sometime fail, so one needs to manualy click _refresh_
- _Fast Refresh_ is only available while in dev mode

---

## JSX

- JSX : _JavaScript eXtension_
- JSX is similar to HTML
- JSX is stricter than HTML (similar to XHTML)
- Convert to HTML to JSX using a tool:
  https://transform.tools/html-to-jsx

---

## JSX is Popular

- JSX became popular with React
- Used by other SPA technologies:
  - **Preact** (Light and compatible)
  - **Vue** (Versatile)
  - **Inferno** (Quick)
  - **Svelte** (Productive)
  - **Solid** (Composable)
- JSX is not part of the JavaScript standard (maybe someday?)

---

## JSX, behind the curtain

Typical JSX

```jsx
<h3 title='alarm'>This alarm is set to {alarmTime}</h3>
```

Then JSX gets compiled by Babel, swc, TypeScript or another tool:

```js
React.createElement(
  'h3',
  { title: 'alarm' },
  'This alarm is set to ',
  alarmTime
);
```

---

## JSX, behind the curtain

After execution, this generates a **React Element** (a simple JS object):

```js
{
  type: 'h3',
  props: {
    title: 'alarm',
    children: ["This alarm is set to ", alarmTime],
  },
  key: null,
  ref: null,
  $$typeof: Symbol.for('react.element'),
};
```

These React elements build a tree structure called **Virtual DOM**.

---

## Dev Experience

Browsers don't understand JSX, one must first compile (transpile) JSX to JS.

To compile to dev mode and start a local dev Web Server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Dev mode** enables the following:

- **Strict Mode**, where every component is rendered twice, to check if your component is compatible with "concurrent rendering".
- **Profiler Mode**, when it is enabled in the "React Dev Tools" browser extension.
- **Hot Module Reloading (HMR)**, which updates the JavaScript live in your app, without having to reload the whole page.

---

## Compile to production

To compile to production mode:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a new `dist` folder, that we can easily deploy to any Web Server.

**Build** will:

- minify the JavaScript code
- Ignore _Strict Mode_, _Profiling_, etc.

---

## Preview the dist folder

To start a **Preview Web Server** for testing the `dist` contents:

```bash
npm run preview
```

Then browse to: http://localhost:4173 (`o` and `enter` starts the browser)

**Please note:**

- No **Hot Module Reloading** (HMR)
- If you change some code, you'll have to **build** again and **reload** the page

---

## Deploy the project

Take the `dist` folder, and deploy it to any static web hosting service.

If you don't know which host to use, you can easily try Netlify (free)

---

## Homework #1

- Create a new React App using Vite
  - Use the Vite doc to create a React app with swc
- Modify the JSX content that was generated in `app.js`. Make a simple home page using your name.
- You can use https://transform.tools/html-to-jsx to convert html to jsx
- Test your app using `npm run dev`
  - Type `o`, or navigate to: `http://localhost:5173`
- Create a production output with with the command `npm run build`
  - This creates a new folder `dist`
- Test the production output using `npm run preview`
  - Browse to `http://localhost:4173`
- Deploy your `dist` folder to a hosting web service, and share the link to your friends.
  - If you need a hosting service, you could use Netlify (free).
