### Install git

You will need to type the following commands from the system command line tool (_bash_, _powershell_, _cmd_, _command prompt_ etc.)

- Have **git** version 2.36 or greater installed. Verify the version number with: `> git --version`
  - Install a recent version from the web site if needed. (http://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Install nvm

To manage the installation of **Node.js**, we use a special installer called **nvm** (node version manager)

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- Check if a recent version of nvm is installed:
  - Use the command line `> nvm version` _(pc)_ `$ nvm -v` _(mac)_
    - Should be v0.39.3 or greater on MacOS
    - Should be 1.1.10 or greater on Windows PCs

- If you need to update or install **nvm** on your machine:
  - First, uninstall **nvm** and **Node.js**
    - On Windows PCs, go to **Settings**, **Apps**, **Apps & features**.
      - Uninstall both **Node.js** and **NVM for Windows**
    - On MacOS, type the following in Terminal:
      - `$ rm -rf $NVM_DIR ~/.npm ~/.bower`

- Install **nvm** on _Windows_ PC

  - Goto https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases/latest
  - At the bottom of the page, download **nvm-setup.zip**
  - Install **nvm** by running the installer

- Install **nvm** on _MacOS_
  - Run the following on Terminal:
  - `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash`

- Freshly installed **nvm** may not be immediately detected on the command line.
  - In that case, just close the console and restart a new command line.
